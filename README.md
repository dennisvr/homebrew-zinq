# homebrew-zinq

`zinq` is a jq-compatible JSON and YAML processor.

## Install

```sh
brew tap dennisvr/zinq
brew trust dennisvr/zinq
brew install zinq
```

The `brew trust` step is required. Homebrew 6 refuses to load formulae from
third-party taps until they are trusted explicitly, so without it `brew install`
fails with `Refusing to load formula dennisvr/zinq/zinq from untrusted tap`.
Trusting the tap covers its current and future formulae; if you would rather
grant the narrowest possible permission, use
`brew trust --formula dennisvr/zinq/zinq` instead and repeat it after each
upgrade.

Once the tap is trusted, the one-line form works too:

```sh
brew install dennisvr/zinq/zinq
```

## Upgrade & uninstall

```sh
brew upgrade zinq
brew uninstall zinq
```

## Releases

Binaries are prebuilt and attached to this repo's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dennisvr/homebrew-zinq/releases). Each release ships one executable per platform — macOS Apple Silicon/Intel and Linux x86_64/ARM64 — with oniguruma statically linked, so there is no separate regex library to install. The macOS builds are self-contained. The Linux builds link glibc dynamically and are produced on Ubuntu 24.04, so they need glibc 2.39 or newer. The `zinq` source is not part of this repository.

Releases are published here automatically: CI in the private source repo builds the per-platform binaries, creates the Release on this repo with the tarballs attached, and commits the matching bump to `Formula/zinq.rb`. The formula is therefore generated — don't edit it by hand.
